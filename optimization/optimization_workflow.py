Optimization Workflow

Create `optimization/optimization_workflow.py` defining workflows that operationalize runtime optimization.
*   **Upgrade 895:** Publish `optimization/optimization_baseline.py` capturing baselines that detect regressions in runtime optimization.
*   **Upgrade 896:** Provide `optimization/optimization_response.py` documenting response patterns that safeguard runtime optimization.
*   **Upgrade 897:** Ship `optimization/optimization_guardian.py` guarding critical guardrails that maintain runtime optimization.
*   **Upgrade 898:** Build `optimization/optimization_exercise.py` codifying exercises that stress-test runtime optimization.
*   **Upgrade 899:** Deliver `optimization/optimization_telemetry.py` expanding telemetry streams that observe runtime optimization.
*   **Upgrade 900:** Engineer `optimization/optimization_companion.py` delivering companion tooling that simplifies runtime optimization.

# AI Control Center

This guide outlines how you might design a downloadable application that integrates AI services on Windows 11. The goal is to create a modular command center with a chat-driven interface capable of connecting to various large language model (LLM) backends.

## Key Components

1. **LLM Backend Selection**
   - Support both local models (using frameworks like [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)) and remote APIs.
   - Allow users to supply API keys for hosted services such as OpenAI or other providers.

2. **Modular Framework**
   - Write the core in a language with broad library support (e.g., Python or Node.js).
   - Expose a plugin interface so additional AI features (vision, speech, automation) can be added without altering the base application.

3. **GUI Chat Interface**
   - Use cross-platform toolkits such as Electron, PyQt, or WinUI to build the main chat window.
   - Provide basic conversation history, prompt controls, and settings to switch between local or remote models.

4. **Background Services**
   - Register the application to start automatically using Windows Task Scheduler or a background service if deeper integration is required.
   - Keep the underlying operating system unmodified; all features run in user space.

5. **Distribution and Updates**
   - Package the software using installers like MSIX or traditional setup executables.
   - Offer automatic updates that download new plugins or model weights.

## Example Skeleton (Python)

```python
# pseudo-code for initializing a chat session
from llm_client import LocalModel, RemoteModel

class ChatControlCenter:
    def __init__(self, use_local=True, api_key=None):
        self.backend = LocalModel() if use_local else RemoteModel(api_key=api_key)

    def ask(self, prompt):
        return self.backend.generate(prompt)

# Create a simple GUI using tkinter
if __name__ == '__main__':
    from tkinter import Tk, Text, Button

    app = Tk()
    chat = ChatControlCenter()

    def on_send():
        user_input = text.get("1.0", "end").strip()
        reply = chat.ask(user_input)
        print("Assistant:", reply)

    text = Text(app)
    text.pack()
    Button(app, text="Send", command=on_send).pack()
    app.mainloop()
```

This code omits error handling and advanced features, but it shows a minimal approach for connecting a GUI to a language model backend.

# Windows-AI

This repository provides a high-level outline for experimenting with AI integrations on Windows 11.

**Important:** Windows 11 is a proprietary operating system and its license terms prohibit creating or distributing modified builds. These notes do not cover how to create a custom build of Windows. Instead they outline how you might integrate AI-driven features on a standard Windows 11 installation you have legally obtained.

## Conceptual Steps

1. **Obtain a licensed Windows 11 installation.** Use a physical machine or a virtual machine (e.g., Hyper-V, VMware, or VirtualBox).
2. **Choose your AI framework.** Popular choices include Python with libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Install development tools that match your hardware (CPU/GPU support). Keep in mind that some AI workloads require significant resources.
3. **Build an application or service layer.** You can integrate AI features by creating Windows applications (for example, using C#, C++/WinRT, or Python with a GUI toolkit). The application might provide features such as voice control, image recognition, or automation.
4. **Automate startup or integrate with the taskbar/shell.** Windows allows you to register background services or scheduled tasks that launch your AI-driven applications when the system boots. This approach keeps the underlying OS intact while providing your custom functionality.
5. **Test extensively in a virtual environment** before deploying to production machines. AI applications may consume significant CPU or memory resources and should be evaluated for stability and security.

For an example of building a chat-centric control center that connects to local or remote language models, see [docs/AI-Control-Center.md](docs/AI-Control-Center.md).
For an outline of a smart installer that automates hardware detection and AI tool setup, see [docs/Smart-Installer.md](docs/Smart-Installer.md).

## Packaging on Windows

To generate standalone executables on Windows:

1. Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
2. From the repository root, run `python scripts/package_windows.py cli` to package the command-line interface or `python scripts/package_windows.py gui` for the GUI.
3. The resulting `.exe` files will be placed in `dist`. Run `dist\windows_ai_cli.exe --help` or double-click `dist\windows_ai_gui.exe` to test.

## Disclaimer

This repository does not contain any modified Windows binaries or installation media. It only offers guidance for building user-space software that runs on top of a genuine Windows 11 installation. Always follow Microsoft licensing terms and local regulations when customizing or distributing software.

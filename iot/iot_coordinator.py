Iot Coordinator

Add `iot/iot_coordinator.py` acting as a coordinator that deepens device orchestration reach.
*   **Upgrade 692:** Introduce `iot/iot_optimizer.py` optimizing pipelines to enhance device orchestration reach.
*   **Upgrade 693:** Implement `iot/iot_bridge.py` bridging supporting services to expand device orchestration reach.
*   **Upgrade 694:** Create `iot/iot_trainer.py` training datasets that accelerate device orchestration reach.
*   **Upgrade 695:** Publish `iot/iot_analyzer.py` analyzing telemetry streams to refine device orchestration reach.
*   **Upgrade 696:** Provide `iot/iot_adapter.py` adapting integrations so device orchestration reach can scale.
*   **Upgrade 697:** Ship `iot/iot_studio.py` delivering studio tooling for teams to shape device orchestration reach.
*   **Upgrade 698:** Build `iot/iot_monitor.py` monitoring execution quality to safeguard device orchestration reach.
*   **Upgrade 699:** Deliver `iot/iot_toolkit.py` packaging toolkit assets that boost device orchestration reach.
*   **Upgrade 700:** Launch `iot/iot_blueprint.py` documenting blueprints that future-proof device orchestration reach.
